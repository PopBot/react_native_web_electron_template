# React Native Web Electron Template

This is an updated template repo (as of February 2023) for creating an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app using React Native -> React Native Web -> Electron.

Script commands are included in `package.json`.

### Running

```shell
npm run build
npm run start
```

This project was hacked together because of Lucas MÃ³rawski's [How to: React Native Web app. A Happy Struggle.], the [MongoDB Guide for setting up React and Electron](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/integrations/electron-cra/), (https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-react-native-web-app-a-happy-struggle-aea7906f4903), [babel-plugin-react-native-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-native-web) npmjs page, and the [Electron Quick Start](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
